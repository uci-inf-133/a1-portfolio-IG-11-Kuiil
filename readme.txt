Academic Integrity Statement

I followed the course academic integrity policy for this assignment. All HTML, CSS, and content in this project was written and customized by me. I used online documentation for reference, including W3Schools, to clarify HTML and CSS syntax and best practices. I also used ChatGPT to help debug validation and accessibility issues, clarify HTML semantics, and reason about WCAG-related warnings. I did not copy an existing portfolio or submit someone else’s work as my own.

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic HTML features:
- Multiple HTML pages (index, experience, projects, contact) with navigation between them
- Semantic HTML elements including header, nav, main, section, article, and footer
- Proper heading hierarchy and structured text content
- Images with descriptive alt text
- External links (email and LinkedIn)
- A contact form with labeled inputs

(b) CSS features:
- Custom color palette defined using CSS variables
- Custom typography using Google Fonts with system fallbacks
- Custom layout, spacing, and card styling
- Hover and focus states for interactivity and accessibility
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap grid and media queries
- Theming of Bootstrap components to match a consistent visual style

(c) Advanced features:
- An accessible data table with a caption, row headers, column headers, and explicit header-to-cell relationships
- An accessible contact form using fieldset, legend, labels, and required inputs
- Responsive navigation and layout behavior across different screen sizes

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern?

Yes. All accessibility **Known Problems** reported by AChecker were resolved.

AChecker reported additional Potential Problems (manual checks). These are informational warnings where the tool cannot confirm context (e.g., image alt text appropriateness or whether scripts affect accessibility). All Errors and Known Problems were addressed.

CSS validation produced one warning:
- “Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif is a vendor extension”

This warning was intentionally ignored because vendor-specific font fallbacks (such as -apple-system) are a widely accepted best practice for consistent cross-platform typography and do not negatively impact accessibility or correctness.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

Approximately 10–12 hours.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment?

- W3C HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/
- W3C CSS Validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- AChecker Accessibility Checker: https://achecker.ca/
- Bootstrap 5 Documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/
- Font Awesome Documentation: https://fontawesome.com/
- Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
- W3Schools HTML & CSS Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/htmlcss/default.asp

I also used ChatGPT as a generative AI assistant to help debug validation and accessibility issues, clarify checker warnings, and reason about HTML structure and accessibility requirements. All suggestions were reviewed and integrated by me.

----------------------------------------------------------------

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I did not consult classmates or other individuals for this assignment.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No special setup is required.

The site can be opened directly by opening `index.html` in a web browser. All assets use relative paths, and no server or build tools are required.
